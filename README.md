## Update, some years later:

I taught myself to code through 'The C Programming Language' and Harvard's 'CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science'. Both of these teach C, and so, at this project's creation, I had only ever known C.

This little project was my first foray into "not C".

So, this is an embarassing (maybe charming?) piece of work from a programmer who was A) only familiar with the C language, and B) pretty new to the whole 'programming' thing anyways.

I keep this repo public because I'm still proud of the achievement, and it's a fun toy to display on my website. But rest-assured, looking at this code today, no one is more disturbed than me!
